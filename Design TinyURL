SYSTEM DESIGN FOR TinyURL

URL shortening simplifies long URLs into short aliases for better usability. Clicking on the short link redirects to the original URL.

Advantages:
1. Convenient and optimized for various devices.
2. Professional, visually engaging, and easily shareable.
3. Reduced error-prone typing.
4. Requires less storage space.

Disadvantages:
1. Loss of brand originality with third-party short URLs.
2. Risk of service shutdown affecting all shortened URLs.
3. Business brand image depends on service trustworthiness.
4. Competition for desirable custom short URLs.

Building Blocks for TinyURL:
1. URL Storage:
   - Manages storage for original and shortened URLs.
2. ID Generator:
   - Generates unique IDs for each shortened URL.
3. Request Handler:
   - Stores and efficiently serves frequent URL-related requests.
4. Rate Limiter:
   - Limits the number of incoming requests to prevent abuse.
Design and Deployment:
- Explains the working of each component and their collaboration.
- Describes the overall mechanism of the components working as a unit.
Encoder:
- Details the inner workings of the encoder.
- Provides reasons for usage and mathematical explanations.
Evaluation:
- Tests the design considering various requirements.
- Explores possibilities for improvement.

TinyURL system design incorporates essential building blocks to manage URL storage, generate unique IDs, handle requests efficiently, and prevent abuse through rate limiting. The design aims to balance convenience and potential drawbacks associated with third-party services.

Functional Requirements:
1. Short URL Generation:
   - Generate a unique short alias for a given URL.
2. Redirection:
   - Redirect users to the original URL using the short link.
3. Custom Short Links:
   - Allow users to create custom short links for their URLs.
4. Deletion:
   - Enable users to delete short links they generated.
5. Update:
   - Allow users to update the associated long URL.
6. Expiry Time:
   - Set a default expiration time for short links, with user customization.

Non-functional Requirements:
1. Availability:
   - Ensure high availability to avoid URL redirection failures.
2. Scalability:
   - Horizontally scale the system to handle increasing demand.
3. Readability:
   - Generate short links that are easily readable and typeable.
4. Latency:
   - Provide low-latency performance for a smooth user experience.
5. Unpredictability:
   - Generate highly unpredictable short URLs for security.

Resource Estimation:
1. Storage Estimation:
   - Total storage required for 5 years: 6 TB.
2. Query Rate Estimation:
   - New URL shortening requests per second: 76 URLs/s.
   - Redirection rate per second: 7.6 K URLs/s.
3. Bandwidth Estimation:
   - Incoming data: 304 Kbps.
   - Outgoing data: 30.4 Mbps.

Memory Estimation:
   - Memory requirement for cache: 66 GB.

Number of Servers Estimation:
   - Number of servers needed: 12,500.

Building Blocks:
1. Database(s):
   - Store the mapping of long URLs to short URLs.
2. Sequencer:
   - Provide unique IDs for short URL generation.
3. Load Balancers:
   - Distribute requests among servers.
4. Caches:
   - Store frequently accessed short URLs.
5. Rate Limiters:
   - Prevent system exploitation.
6. Servers:
   - Handle service requests and run application logic.
7. Base-58 Encoder:
   - Transform numeric IDs for better readability.

   TinyURL design focuses on functionality, performance, and scalability, with key components like databases, sequencers, load balancers, caches, rate limiters, servers, and encoders. Estimations guide resource allocation for an efficient and effective system.
