Heap- binary tree

min Heap

                    10
                    /\
                  20  15
                  /\   /\
                50 18  

                if the 18 is less than 20 then you have to swap
                    10
                    /\
                  18  15
                  /\   /\
                50 20 5  40
                since 5 is less than 15 and also less than the top heap (10) then 5 will move all the way up

                    5
                    /\
                  18  10
                  /\   /\
                50 20 15  40


** keep in mind that heap is not sorted as long as it is more than the parent for min heap and less than the parents for Max Heap

Min / Max is always on the top for Heap (thing will bubble to the time if it is not order correctly )

Heaps are used for implement prioperty queue cuz order doesnt matter
