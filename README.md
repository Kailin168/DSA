# Data Structures and Algorithms Notes Repository
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Notes repository! This repository contains notes and examples for data structures and algorithm topics that can be used for review.

### Notes
The repository contains notes on various data structures and algorithm concepts. You can find notes on topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.

### Examples
In addition to notes, the repository also contains practical examples of Data Structures and Algorithm questions from Leetcode. The examples are solved in either Javascript or Python and labeled with a Leetcode question number. These examples are designed to help you understand how to apply the concepts covered in the notes.

### Contributing
If you find an error in any of the notes or examples or would like to contribute to the repository, please feel free to create a pull request. I welcome contributions from the community and are always looking for ways to improve the content in the repository.
