Blob Store

A blob store is a storage solution designed for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and other multimedia files. It employs a flat data organization, devoid of hierarchical structures. This is particularly useful for applications with a "write once, read many" (WORM) requirement, where data remains immutable after creation. Popular platforms like Microsoft Azure utilize this approach, creating blobs that can't be modified and are retained for specified periods.

Importance of Blob Stores:
Blob stores are integral to data-intensive applications like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook. These applications generate vast amounts of unstructured data daily. Their need for scalable, reliable, and highly available storage is met by blob stores. For instance, YouTube requires petabytes of storage daily due to video uploads in various resolutions and extensive replication for availability.
