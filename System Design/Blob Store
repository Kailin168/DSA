Blob Store:

A blob store is a storage solution designed for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and other multimedia files. It employs a flat data organization, devoid of hierarchical structures. This is particularly useful for applications with a "write once, read many" (WORM) requirement, where data remains immutable after creation. Popular platforms like Microsoft Azure utilize this approach, creating blobs that can't be modified and are retained for specified periods.

Importance of Blob Stores:
Blob stores are integral to data-intensive applications like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook. These applications generate vast amounts of unstructured data daily. Their need for scalable, reliable, and highly available storage is met by blob stores. For instance, YouTube requires petabytes of storage daily due to video uploads in various resolutions and extensive replication for availability.

Designing a Blob Store System:
The design of a blob store system comprises several phases:
    1. Requirements: Identify functional and non-functional requirements, estimating the necessary resources.
    2. Design: Develop a high-level design, API design, and detailed component design. This entails explaining the workflow and components in depth.
    3. Design Considerations: Discuss crucial design aspects such as database schema, partitioning strategy, blob indexing, pagination, and replication.
    4. Evaluation: Assess the designed blob store against the established requirements.
Blob stores cater to the storage needs of applications dealing with unstructured data. Their design encompasses requirements identification, high-level design, API formulation, detailed component design, and evaluation. Understanding the nuances of blob store system design is essential for developing efficient and effective storage solutions.

Requirements and Estimations for Blob Store System Design

To design an efficient blob store system, it's crucial to identify the functional and non-functional requirements as well as make estimations regarding resource needs. Here's a breakdown of the requirements and estimations:

**Functional Requirements:**
  1. Create a Container: Users should be able to create containers to group blobs, facilitating organized data storage for different purposes. A user can create multiple containers, each containing multiple blobs.
  2. Put Data: Users must be able to upload blobs to the created containers. This involves data insertion into the blob store.
  3. Get Data: The system should generate URLs for uploaded blobs, enabling users to access them later via these URLs.
  4. Delete Data: Users should have the ability to delete blobs. Data can be retained for a specified retention time before permanent deletion.
  5. List Blobs: Users should be able to retrieve a list of blobs within a specific container.
  6. Delete a Container: Users should be able to delete a container and all the blobs it contains.
  7. List Containers: Users should have the capability to list all containers under a specific account.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
  1. Availability: The system needs to be highly available, ensuring uninterrupted access to stored blobs.
  2. Durability: Uploaded data should remain safe and retrievable. Data loss should only occur if explicitly deleted.
  3. Scalability: The system should be able to handle a massive volume of blobs, accommodating billions of entries.
  4. Throughput: The system should offer high data throughput for efficient data transfer, especially for large files.
  5. Reliability: Given the likelihood of failures in distributed systems, the design should promptly detect and recover from failures.
  6. Consistency: The system should maintain strong consistency, ensuring that all users see the same version of a blob.

Resource Estimations:
  Number of Servers Estimation:
  Based on the assumption of 5 million daily active users and a blob store server handling 500 queries per second, approximately 10,000 servers are required to meet this demand.

  Storage Estimation:
  Assuming an average video size of 50 MB and an average thumbnail size of 20 KB, with 250,000 videos uploaded daily, the total storage required for YouTube videos and thumbnails is approximately 12.51 terabytes per day.

  Bandwidth Estimation:
  For incoming traffic, the bandwidth required is calculated based on the total data uploaded per day, resulting in 12.51 terabytes per day. For outgoing traffic, the bandwidth needed is calculated considering user queries and data size, resulting in the bandwidth needed for downloading videos.

  Building Blocks:
  The design of the blob store system relies on several essential building blocks, including a rate limiter to control user interactions, a load balancer for distributing requests, a database for metadata storage, and monitoring for storage device inspection.

  Designing an effective blob store system involves understanding the functional and non-functional requirements, making accurate estimations for resource needs, and utilizing appropriate building blocks to create a robust and scalable solution.

Designing a Blob Store System:

Designing a blob store system involves incorporating various requirements into the system's architecture. Here's a simplified overview of the design process:

  **High-Level Design:**
  Components: The system consists of clients, front-end servers, and storage disks.
  Workflow: Client requests are processed by front-end servers, which store data on attached storage disks.

  **API Design:**
  The system offers several API functions for registered and authenticated users:
  1. Create Container: Create a new container under the user's account.
  2. Upload Blobs: Store user data as bytes in containers.
  3. Download Blobs: Retrieve blobs by their unique names or IDs.
  4. Delete Blob: Mark blobs for deletion; actual deletion occurs during garbage collection.
  5. List Blobs: Retrieve a list of blobs within a specific container.
  6. Delete Container: Mark containers for deletion, along with their blobs.
  7. List Containers: List containers under a user's account.

Detailed Design:
  Components: Key components include Clients, Rate Limiter, Load Balancer, Front-end Servers, Data Nodes, Manager Node, Metadata Storage, Monitoring Service, and Administrator.
  Workflow: The workflow involves operations like writing a blob, reading a blob, and deleting a blob.

Components and Workflow:
  1. Client: Initiates API requests for various operations.
  2. Rate Limiter: Ensures request limits are not exceeded.
  3. Load Balancer: Distributes requests among servers, possibly based on location or data centers.
  4. Front-end Servers: Process user requests and forward them to appropriate storage servers.
  5. Data Nodes: Store actual blob data, possibly in chunks.
  6. Manager Node: Manages data nodes, assigns unique IDs to blobs, handles replication, and maintains metadata.
  7. Metadata Storage: Stores metadata including account, container, and blob information.
  8. Monitoring Service: Monitors the health of data nodes and manager nodes, alerts administrators in case of issues.
  9. Administrator: Manages notifications, conducts routine system checkups.

Components and Workflow:
Client: Initiates API requests for various operations.
Rate Limiter: Ensures request limits are not exceeded.
Load Balancer: Distributes requests among servers, possibly based on location or data centers.
Front-end Servers: Process user requests and forward them to appropriate storage servers.
Data Nodes: Store actual blob data, possibly in chunks.
Manager Node: Manages data nodes, assigns unique IDs to blobs, handles replication, and maintains metadata.
Metadata Storage: Stores metadata including account, container, and blob information.
