Blob Store:

A blob store is a storage solution designed for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and other multimedia files. It employs a flat data organization, devoid of hierarchical structures. This is particularly useful for applications with a "write once, read many" (WORM) requirement, where data remains immutable after creation. Popular platforms like Microsoft Azure utilize this approach, creating blobs that can't be modified and are retained for specified periods.

Importance of Blob Stores:
Blob stores are integral to data-intensive applications like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook. These applications generate vast amounts of unstructured data daily. Their need for scalable, reliable, and highly available storage is met by blob stores. For instance, YouTube requires petabytes of storage daily due to video uploads in various resolutions and extensive replication for availability.

Designing a Blob Store System:
The design of a blob store system comprises several phases:
    1. Requirements: Identify functional and non-functional requirements, estimating the necessary resources.
    2. Design: Develop a high-level design, API design, and detailed component design. This entails explaining the workflow and components in depth.
    3. Design Considerations: Discuss crucial design aspects such as database schema, partitioning strategy, blob indexing, pagination, and replication.
    4. Evaluation: Assess the designed blob store against the established requirements.
Blob stores cater to the storage needs of applications dealing with unstructured data. Their design encompasses requirements identification, high-level design, API formulation, detailed component design, and evaluation. Understanding the nuances of blob store system design is essential for developing efficient and effective storage solutions.

Requirements and Estimations for Blob Store System Design

To design an efficient blob store system, it's crucial to identify the functional and non-functional requirements as well as make estimations regarding resource needs. Here's a breakdown of the requirements and estimations:

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Create a Container: Users should be able to create containers to group blobs, facilitating organized data storage for different purposes. A user can create multiple containers, each containing multiple blobs.

2. Put Data: Users must be able to upload blobs to the created containers. This involves data insertion into the blob store.

3. Get Data: The system should generate URLs for uploaded blobs, enabling users to access them later via these URLs.

4. Delete Data: Users should have the ability to delete blobs. Data can be retained for a specified retention time before permanent deletion.

5. List Blobs: Users should be able to retrieve a list of blobs within a specific container.

6. Delete a Container: Users should be able to delete a container and all the blobs it contains.

7. List Containers: Users should have the capability to list all containers under a specific account.
