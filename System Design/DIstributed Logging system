Distributed Logging System Design

Definition: A log file is a record that documents events within a software application. It captures details such as microservices, transactions, and service actions, providing a means to troubleshoot and monitor the application's flow.

Need for Logging:

1. Understanding Distributed Systems: Logging is crucial in comprehending the flow of events in a distributed system. It plays a vital role in pinpointing the timing and causes of system failures or security breaches, ultimately reducing downtime.

2. Efficient Debugging: Instead of relying on simple print statements, structured logging provides a more organized and efficient way to monitor applications. Print statements lack severity tracking and don't suit the needs of storing data in a structured manner.

3. Causality Management: Distributed systems often require causality information to ensure events are correctly sequenced across multiple nodes. Logging services effectively manage diagnostic and exploratory data in distributed software.

4. Performance and Error Detection: Logging aids in understanding code, locating unforeseen errors, and optimizing application performance. It provides insight into how processes are running in the system.
