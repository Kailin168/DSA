SQL vs NoSQL

SQL is relational 
> For structured data
> Table-based
> Vertical scalable
> Uses Foreign key, Primary key, Unique key
> Use case: banking and e-commerce 
> SQLite and PostgreSQL


NoSQL is non relational
> For semi-structured, structured, and un-structured data
> NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores
> NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON
> Horizontal scalable
> MongoDB
