Google Maps Design

What is Google Maps?
Google Maps is a service that helps users find the best routes from one place to another, considering factors like transportation mode, distance, and time. It provides multiple path options and real-time traffic information. Google Maps can answer questions about routes, distances, and estimated travel times.

When do we use a maps service?

Maps services are used in various situations:
1. Individual Navigation: People use maps to find directions to new places, reducing travel time and costs.
2. Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA): Maps provide ETAs based on current traffic data.
3. Applications and Services: Modern apps like ride-sharing and delivery services rely on maps for efficient navigation.

Building Blocks for Google Maps:
1. Location Search: The system should enable searching for locations on the map.
2. Key-Value Metadata Storage: Efficient data management requires storing metadata in a key-value format.
3. Event Handling: The system should generate and handle events, notifying other services when needed.
4. Structured Graph Data: Road data is effectively represented using a structured graph format for storing and retrieving information.

Google Maps is a popular web mapping tool that provides various geographic data like street maps, satellite imagery, real-time traffic updates, and directions for users. It can be accessed via web browsers or mobile apps. 

1. What is Google Maps?
Google Maps is a service developed by Google that offers satellite images, street maps, real-time traffic updates, and route planning for different modes of transportation.

2. Requirements for Google Maps System Design
Functional Requirements:
- Display maps with zoom levels and different views (satellite, terrain, street).
- Allow location search by addresses or landmarks and recommend optimal routes based on transportation type.
- Display real-time traffic conditions and weather updates.
- Provide "near me" searches for places with ratings, opening times, services, and routes.
Non-functional Requirements:
- High availability with minimal downtime.
- Scalability to support a large number of users and requests.
- Accurate and current information.
- Secure user data and system.

3. Capacity Estimation
Data Storage:
- Map data estimated at 1 Petabyte (PB).
- Traffic data around 500 Terabytes (TB) daily.
- Point of Interest (POI) data over 100 TB.
Server Resources:
- Massive computational power for handling user requests and real-time updates.
- Millions of servers globally with varying specifications.
Network Bandwidth:
- Billions of requests daily, requiring massive bandwidth.

4. Why Quad Tree in Google Maps?
Google Maps doesn't strictly use quad trees but employs similar concepts for spatial efficiency and fast lookups, especially for dynamic data like traffic flow.

5. Low-Level Design
- Map data stored in distributed file systems.
- Real-time traffic data processed using stream processing frameworks.
- POI data stored in geospatial databases.
- Efficient map tile serving, traffic flow calculations, and POI search implemented.

6. High-Level Design
- Presentation layer for rendering maps and user interactions.
- Application layer for real-time data processing and routing.
- Data layer for database management.

7. Database Design
Google Maps uses a distributed database architecture with databases for map data, routing, places, and real-time data storage.
