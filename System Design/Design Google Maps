What is Google Maps?
Google Maps is a service that helps users find the best routes from one place to another, considering factors like transportation mode, distance, and time. It provides multiple path options and real-time traffic information. Google Maps can answer questions about routes, distances, and estimated travel times.

When do we use a maps service?

Maps services are used in various situations:
1. Individual Navigation: People use maps to find directions to new places, reducing travel time and costs.
2. Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA): Maps provide ETAs based on current traffic data.
3. Applications and Services: Modern apps like ride-sharing and delivery services rely on maps for efficient navigation.

Building Blocks for Google Maps:
1. Location Search: The system should enable searching for locations on the map.
2. Key-Value Metadata Storage: Efficient data management requires storing metadata in a key-value format.
3. Event Handling: The system should generate and handle events, notifying other services when needed.
4. Structured Graph Data: Road data is effectively represented using a structured graph format for storing and retrieving information.

Google Maps is a popular web mapping tool that provides various geographic data like street maps, satellite imagery, real-time traffic updates, and directions for users. It can be accessed via web browsers or mobile apps.
