System Design Uber

Uber is a ride-hailing service that connects riders with drivers using a mobile app. Here's a simplified overview of its system design:

What is Uber?

Uber is an app-based platform for ride-hailing services.
It allows users to book rides from one location to another using the app.
Drivers register their vehicles and offer rides to users through the app.

Uber, despite its seemingly simple user experience, relies on a complex infrastructure to make each ride happen. Behind the scenes, there's a vast network of services and a huge volume of data to support the platform.

Uber's backend started as a single, monolithic software architecture using Python and SQLAlchemy for database management. However, it has since evolved into a service-oriented architecture with hundreds of services.

Uber's backend doesn't just handle ride hailing but also food delivery and cargo services. It primarily serves mobile app traffic over mobile data.

At its core, Uber uses a Dispatch system that acts like a real-time market, matching drivers (supply) with riders (demand).

- Supply Service tracks cars using geolocation and various attributes like the number of seats and the presence of car seats or wheelchair accessibility. It also manages vehicle allocation.

- Demand Service tracks rider GPS locations and their requirements for rides.

- DISCO (Dispatch Optimization) is the service that matches riders to drivers in real-time, ensuring efficient routing and minimizing waiting times.

Uber's geospatial design divides the Earth into small cells using Google S2 library. These cells have unique IDs used as sharding keys for scaling.
