System Design Uber

Uber is a ride-hailing service that connects riders with drivers using a mobile app. Here's a simplified overview of its system design:

What is Uber?

Uber is an app-based platform for ride-hailing services.
It allows users to book rides from one location to another using the app.
Drivers register their vehicles and offer rides to users through the app.

Uber, despite its seemingly simple user experience, relies on a complex infrastructure to make each ride happen. Behind the scenes, there's a vast network of services and a huge volume of data to support the platform.

Uber's backend started as a single, monolithic software architecture using Python and SQLAlchemy for database management. However, it has since evolved into a service-oriented architecture with hundreds of services.

Uber's backend doesn't just handle ride hailing but also food delivery and cargo services. It primarily serves mobile app traffic over mobile data.

At its core, Uber uses a Dispatch system that acts like a real-time market, matching drivers (supply) with riders (demand).
