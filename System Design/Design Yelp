Yelp Design

What is Yelp?
- Yelp is a platform that helps people discover and connect with local businesses. Users can find businesses, read reviews, make reservations, schedule appointments, and even purchase products. It's like a one-stop-shop for local business interactions. Users can also upload photos and videos related to these places. 

Functional Requirements:
1. Business Profile: Yelp allows business owners or customers to create pages for businesses.
2. Search by Location: Users can search for attractions by location or GPS coordinates. They can also search for nearby places.
3. Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave reviews and ratings (in stars out of 5) for places they've visited or services they've used.
4. Photo and Video Upload: Users can upload photos and videos related to a place.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- High Availability: Yelp's search service should be highly available.
- Scalability: The system should handle peak demands during holiday seasons or at tourist attractions.
- Low Latency: Users should access information quickly.

Data Estimations:
- Storing data for 500M places with a 20% yearly growth.
- 1MB (excluding media) for metadata related to a location.
- Read-heavy system with a 1:1000 write to read ratio and up to 100k concurrent users at peak.
