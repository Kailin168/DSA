Yelp Design

What is Yelp?
- Yelp is a platform that helps people discover and connect with local businesses. Users can find businesses, read reviews, make reservations, schedule appointments, and even purchase products. It's like a one-stop-shop for local business interactions. Users can also upload photos and videos related to these places.
