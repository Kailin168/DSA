Distributed Messaging Queue

What is a messaging queue?
A messaging queue is an intermediary component that facilitates communication between producers and consumers. Producers send messages to the queue, while consumers retrieve and process these messages. Multiple producers and consumers can interact with the queue simultaneously.

Motivation
A messaging queue offers several advantages and serves various purposes:
  1. Improved performance: By enabling asynchronous communication, a messaging queue eliminates speed differences between producers and consumers. Producers can send messages without waiting for consumers, and consumers process messages when they become available. This approach helps reduce client-perceived latency and separates slower operations from critical paths.

  2. Better reliability: The use of a messaging queue enhances system fault tolerance. If a producer or consumer fails, it can restart independently without affecting others. Replicating the queue across multiple servers ensures availability even if some servers are down.

  3. Granular scalability: Asynchronous communication allows for more scalable systems. Multiple processes can communicate via a messaging queue, and when the number of requests increases, workload distribution across multiple consumers becomes possible. Applications can adjust the number of producers or consumers as needed.

  4. Easy decoupling: A messaging queue decouples dependencies between different entities in a system. Entities communicate via messages without needing knowledge of each other's internal workings.

  5. Rate limiting: Messaging queues help absorb load spikes and prevent services from becoming overloaded. They can act as a rudimentary form of rate limiting to avoid dropping incoming requests.

  6. Priority queue: Multiple queues can be used to implement different priorities. Each priority can have its own queue, allowing higher-priority messages to receive more service time.
