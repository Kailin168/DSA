Distributed Monitoring

Simplifying the concept of monitoring:

Monitoring is crucial for the smooth operation of modern IT infrastructure, which includes hardware, distributed services, and network resources. These components are interconnected, making it difficult to ensure everything works without issues or application downtime.

Understanding the problem:
When our infrastructure is spread across multiple locations and consists of many servers, it becomes challenging to identify issues at the hardware or application level. Failures, response delays, overloaded or unreachable hardware, and resource shortages in containers are some of the problems that can occur. With multiple services running in such an infrastructure, any of them can go wrong, potentially causing other services to crash and rendering the application unavailable. If we don't identify the problem early on, it can take a lot of time and effort to manually debug the system. Additionally, for larger services, we need to ensure they meet our agreed service-level agreements. Hence, it is important to detect trends and warning signs of potential failures to address concerns or issues promptly.

The role of monitoring:
Monitoring helps in analyzing complex infrastructures where failures are a constant possibility. It involves collecting, interpreting, and displaying data about the interactions between processes that run simultaneously. Monitoring assists in debugging, testing, evaluating performance, and gaining an overview of multiple services.

Designing a distributed monitoring system:
To design a distributed monitoring system, we break it down into the following chapters and lessons:

1. Distributed Monitoring:
   - Introduction to Distributed Monitoring: Understanding the importance of monitoring in a distributed system, the cost of downtime, and types of monitoring.

2. Prerequisites for a Monitoring System:
   - Exploring essential concepts about metrics and alerting in a monitoring system.

3. Monitoring Server-side Errors:
   - Designing a Monitoring System: Defining the requirements and high-level design of the monitoring system.
   - A Detailed Design of the Monitoring System: Delving into the specific components involved in designing a monitoring system.
   - Visualize Data in a Monitoring System: Learning a unique way to visualize a large amount of monitoring data.

4. Monitor Client-side Errors:
   - Focusing on Client-side Errors: Understanding client-side errors and the importance of monitoring them.
   - Designing a Client-side Monitoring System: Learning how to design a system that monitors client-side errors.

An example will be used to demonstrate why monitoring is essential in a distributed system. The lesson will also cover the cost of downtime due to failures and different types of monitoring.


Introduction to Distributed Monitoring
In this section, we'll learn why monitoring is crucial in a distributed system. We'll cover the following points:

1. Need for monitoring:
   - When a single service fails in a distributed system, it can cause problems in related systems. Monitoring helps detect failures early and prevent cascading issues.
   - For example, if a user uploads a video on YouTube, various services in different servers handle different tasks. If one service fails, it can lead to errors and disrupt the user experience.
   - With complex infrastructures and numerous servers globally, manually identifying and resolving problems becomes challenging. Monitoring reduces operational costs and automates the detection of failures.

2. Downtime cost:
   - Unplanned outages can be costly for businesses. For instance, Meta (formerly Facebook) experienced a nearly nine-hour outage in 2021, resulting in a loss of around $13 million per hour.
   - The IT infrastructure is spread worldwide, and monitoring servers in geographically separated data centers is essential.
   - Outages can have a significant impact, as shown by an example where an AWS service issue resulted in connection delays and performance problems, costing approximately $66,240 per minute.

3. Types of monitoring:
   - To understand the types of errors we need to monitor, let's consider an example from Educative, where learners connect to an executable environment.
   - We can categorize monitoring focus into two broad types of errors:
     - Service-side errors: These occur on servers and are typically visible to monitoring services. They are reported as error 5xx in HTTP response codes.
     - Client-side errors: These originate from the client-side and may go unnoticed by the service. They are reported as error 4xx in HTTP response codes. Some client-side errors occur when client requests fail to reach the service.
   - Designing a monitoring system that handles both service-side and client-side errors allows better analysis of globally distributed services and enables timely detection and response to faults.

In the upcoming chapters, we'll explore monitoring server-side errors and client-side errors in more detail, focusing on designing effective monitoring systems.
