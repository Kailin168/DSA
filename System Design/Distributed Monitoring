Distributed Monitoring

Simplifying the concept of monitoring:

Monitoring is crucial for the smooth operation of modern IT infrastructure, which includes hardware, distributed services, and network resources. These components are interconnected, making it difficult to ensure everything works without issues or application downtime.

Understanding the problem:
When our infrastructure is spread across multiple locations and consists of many servers, it becomes challenging to identify issues at the hardware or application level. Failures, response delays, overloaded or unreachable hardware, and resource shortages in containers are some of the problems that can occur. With multiple services running in such an infrastructure, any of them can go wrong, potentially causing other services to crash and rendering the application unavailable. If we don't identify the problem early on, it can take a lot of time and effort to manually debug the system. Additionally, for larger services, we need to ensure they meet our agreed service-level agreements. Hence, it is important to detect trends and warning signs of potential failures to address concerns or issues promptly.

The role of monitoring:
Monitoring helps in analyzing complex infrastructures where failures are a constant possibility. It involves collecting, interpreting, and displaying data about the interactions between processes that run simultaneously. Monitoring assists in debugging, testing, evaluating performance, and gaining an overview of multiple services.

Designing a distributed monitoring system:
To design a distributed monitoring system, we break it down into the following chapters and lessons:

1. Distributed Monitoring:
   - Introduction to Distributed Monitoring: Understanding the importance of monitoring in a distributed system, the cost of downtime, and types of monitoring.

2. Prerequisites for a Monitoring System:
   - Exploring essential concepts about metrics and alerting in a monitoring system.

3. Monitoring Server-side Errors:
   - Designing a Monitoring System: Defining the requirements and high-level design of the monitoring system.
   - A Detailed Design of the Monitoring System: Delving into the specific components involved in designing a monitoring system.
   - Visualize Data in a Monitoring System: Learning a unique way to visualize a large amount of monitoring data.

4. Monitor Client-side Errors:
   - Focusing on Client-side Errors: Understanding client-side errors and the importance of monitoring them.
   - Designing a Client-side Monitoring System: Learning how to design a system that monitors client-side errors.

In the next lesson, an example will be used to demonstrate why monitoring is essential in a distributed system. The lesson will also cover the cost of downtime due to failures and different types of monitoring.
