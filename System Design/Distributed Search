The Distributed Search

Functional Requirements:
1. Search Functionality: The system must support efficient text-based search queries, enabling users to find relevant content quickly.
2. Scalability: The system should be able to handle a large number of search queries concurrently, ensuring responsiveness even during peak usage.
3. Indexing: A mechanism for creating and updating searchable indexes of content must be in place.
4. Query Parsing: Effective parsing and interpretation of user queries to generate accurate search results.
5. Ranking: Implement a ranking algorithm to prioritize search results based on relevance.
6. Query Suggestions: Offer query suggestions or autocomplete to assist users in refining their searches.
7. Filtering and Faceting: Allow users to filter and facet search results to refine their queries further.
8. Security: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data if applicable.
9. Logging and Analytics: Capture search analytics and logs for system monitoring and improvements.

Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Performance: Deliver search results within a few seconds or less to ensure a seamless user experience.
2. Availability: Maintain high availability to prevent service disruptions, even during server failures or maintenance.
3. Reliability: Minimize the risk of errors and system failures to ensure consistent search functionality.
4. Scalability: Design the system to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing query loads.
5. Data Consistency: Ensure that the search index remains consistent with the underlying data source.
6. Resource Utilization: Optimize resource utilization, including server resources, storage, and bandwidth.
7. Fault Tolerance: Implement measures to handle and recover from system failures gracefully.
8. Security: Protect against security threats, including data breaches and unauthorized access.
9. Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring tools and logging mechanisms to track system performance and diagnose issues.
10. Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection and privacy regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA.
11. Cost-Effectiveness: Design the system with cost-efficient resource allocation and management.
12. User Experience: Prioritize a user-friendly interface and responsive search results presentation.

Requirements and Resource Estimation for Distributed Search System Design
Functional Requirements:
  Search: The system must provide users with relevant content based on their search queries.
  Non-Functional Requirements:
  Availability: The system should maintain high availability for users.
  Scalability: It should be capable of handling large amounts of data and queries efficiently.
  Fast Search on Big Data: Regardless of the content's volume, users should receive quick search results.
  Reduced Cost: The overall cost of building and maintaining the search system should be minimized.
Resource Estimation:
  Number of Servers Estimation:
  Daily active users for YouTube search: 3 million.
  Queries handled per server: 1,000.
  Number of Servers Required = (Daily Active Users) / (Queries Handled per Server)
  Number of Servers Required = 3,000 servers
