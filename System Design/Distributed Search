The Distributed Search

Functional Requirements:
1. Search Functionality: The system must support efficient text-based search queries, enabling users to find relevant content quickly.

2. Scalability: The system should be able to handle a large number of search queries concurrently, ensuring responsiveness even during peak usage.

3. Indexing: A mechanism for creating and updating searchable indexes of content must be in place.

4. Query Parsing: Effective parsing and interpretation of user queries to generate accurate search results.

5. Ranking: Implement a ranking algorithm to prioritize search results based on relevance.

6. Query Suggestions: Offer query suggestions or autocomplete to assist users in refining their searches.

7. Filtering and Faceting: Allow users to filter and facet search results to refine their queries further.

8. Security: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data if applicable.

9. Logging and Analytics: Capture search analytics and logs for system monitoring and improvements.

Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Performance: Deliver search results within a few seconds or less to ensure a seamless user experience.

2. Availability: Maintain high availability to prevent service disruptions, even during server failures or maintenance.

3. Reliability: Minimize the risk of errors and system failures to ensure consistent search functionality.

4. Scalability: Design the system to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing query loads.

5. Data Consistency: Ensure that the search index remains consistent with the underlying data source.

6. Resource Utilization: Optimize resource utilization, including server resources, storage, and bandwidth.
