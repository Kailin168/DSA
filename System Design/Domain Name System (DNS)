Introduction to Domain Name System (DNS): how domain names get translated to IP addresses through DNS.

  To understand the origins of DNS (Domain Name System), let's use the analogy of a mobile phone. Just like each user has a unique phone number, computers on the internet are identified by IP addresses. However, remembering IP addresses can be difficult, just like trying to remember all the phone numbers of our contacts.

  To solve this problem, we use a phone book to store and retrieve phone numbers. Similarly, DNS acts as the internet's phone book. It maintains a repository of mappings between domain names (e.g., educative.io) and their corresponding IP addresses (e.g., 104.18.2.119).

  Instead of typing an IP address to visit a website, we can simply enter the domain name, and DNS will look up the corresponding IP address for us. It simplifies the process and makes it easier for humans to access websites without having to remember complex IP addresses.


DNS (Domain Name System) is like the Internet's phone book. It translates human-friendly domain names (like educative.io) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 104.18.2.119). When a user enters a domain name in their browser, the browser asks the DNS infrastructure to find the corresponding IP address. Once the IP address is obtained, the user's request is sent to the correct web server.

Key points about DNS:

- DNS is not a single server, but a complete infrastructure with multiple servers called name servers.
- The DNS database stores domain name to IP address mappings as resource records (RRs). RRs contain information like the type, name, and value of the mapping.
- DNS uses caching to reduce latency by storing frequently used mappings.
- DNS operates in a hierarchical structure, which allows it to handle the increasing size and query load of the Internet.




How the Domain Name System Works
DNS Hierarchy:
  DNS is not a single server but a hierarchical infrastructure with different types of servers.
  DNS resolvers are servers that initiate queries and forward requests to other DNS servers. They can also cache DNS mappings.
  Root-level name servers receive requests from local servers and maintain servers for top-level domains (TLDs) like .com, .edu, etc.
  TLD name servers hold the IP addresses of authoritative name servers for specific domains.
  Authoritative name servers are owned by organizations and provide IP addresses for their web or application servers.

DNS Query Resolution:
  DNS queries can be performed iteratively or recursively.
  In iterative resolution, the local server directly requests the root, TLD, and authoritative servers for the IP address.
  In recursive resolution, the end user requests the local server, which then requests the root servers and forwards the request to other servers.

Caching in DNS:
  Caching involves temporarily storing frequently requested resource records to reduce response time and network traffic.
  Caching can occur in browsers, operating systems, local name servers, and ISP DNS resolvers.
  Caching helps reduce the load on the DNS infrastructure and can be beneficial even when no cache is available for a specific query.

DNS as a Distributed System:
  DNS itself is a distributed system with advantages such as avoiding single points of failure, low query latency, and flexibility during maintenance or server issues.
  There are 13 logical root name servers managed by 12 organizations, spread across the globe.
  DNS is highly scalable due to its hierarchical structure, with replicated instances of root-level servers and the involvement of TLD and authoritative servers.

Scalability, Reliability, and Consistency:
  DNS is highly scalable due to its hierarchical structure, dividing the workload among different servers.
  DNS achieves reliability through caching, server replication, and the use of UDP for faster performance.
  DNS compromises strong consistency for high performance, providing eventual consistency and updating records lazily across replicated servers.
  The time it takes for updates to propagate depends on the DNS infrastructure, update size, and the part of the DNS tree being updated.
