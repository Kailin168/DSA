System design uses the concepts of computer networking, parallel computing, and distributed systems to make a system that is scalable and great performance. 

Main part of system design:
Reliable- whether it can handle failure and errors
Effective- whether it meet all user needs and business requirements
Maintainable- whether it is flexible and can easily scale up or down.
