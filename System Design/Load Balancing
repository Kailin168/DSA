The load balancing layer is the first point of contact within a data center after the firewall. A load balancer may not be required if a service entertains a few hundred or even a few thousand requests per second. However, for increasing client requests, load balancers provide the following capabilities:


Scalability: By adding servers, the capacity of the application/service can be increased seamlessly. Load balancers make such upscaling or downscaling transparent to the end users.
Availability: Even if some servers go down or suffer a fault, the system still remains available. One of the jobs of the load balancers is to hide faults and failures of servers.
Performance: Load balancers can forward requests to servers with a lesser load so the user can get a quicker response time. This not only improves performance but also improves resource utilization.



Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB):

- GSLB ensures that incoming traffic is intelligently distributed to different data centers.
- It makes forwarding decisions based on factors like users' geographic locations, server availability, and data center health.
- GSLB can reroute traffic to alternative data centers in case of failures or high load.
- It can be implemented on-premises or obtained through Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS).

Load Balancing in DNS:

- DNS can perform GSLB by responding with multiple IP addresses for a DNS query.
- DNS uses a simple technique of reordering the list of IP addresses in each response to distribute the load among different data centers.
- Round-robin is commonly used in DNS for load balancing, but it has limitations such as uneven load distribution and slow recovery from failures.
- DNS's small packet size and limited control over client behavior require additional layers of load balancing.

Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs):

- ADCs are local load balancers deployed within a data center.
- They act as reverse proxies and divide incoming requests among available servers.
- ADCs use a virtual IP address (VIP) to seamlessly connect incoming client requests to the appropriate server.
- ADCs help solve some of the limitations of DNS-based load balancing, such as control over client behavior, determining the closest server, and faster recovery from failures.

Note: While DNS-based load balancing is a form of GSLB, other methods like ADCs and cloud-based load balancing are more advanced options for GSLB.
