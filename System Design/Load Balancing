The load balancing layer is the first point of contact within a data center after the firewall. A load balancer may not be required if a service entertains a few hundred or even a few thousand requests per second. However, for increasing client requests, load balancers provide the following capabilities:


Scalability: By adding servers, the capacity of the application/service can be increased seamlessly. Load balancers make such upscaling or downscaling transparent to the end users.
Availability: Even if some servers go down or suffer a fault, the system still remains available. One of the jobs of the load balancers is to hide faults and failures of servers.
Performance: Load balancers can forward requests to servers with a lesser load so the user can get a quicker response time. This not only improves performance but also improves resource utilization.



Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB):

- GSLB ensures that incoming traffic is intelligently distributed to different data centers.
- It makes forwarding decisions based on factors like users' geographic locations, server availability, and data center health.
- GSLB can reroute traffic to alternative data centers in case of failures or high load.
- It can be implemented on-premises or obtained through Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS).

Load Balancing in DNS:

- DNS can perform GSLB by responding with multiple IP addresses for a DNS query.
- DNS uses a simple technique of reordering the list of IP addresses in each response to distribute the load among different data centers.
- Round-robin is commonly used in DNS for load balancing, but it has limitations such as uneven load distribution and slow recovery from failures.
- DNS's small packet size and limited control over client behavior require additional layers of load balancing.

Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs):

- ADCs are local load balancers deployed within a data center.
- They act as reverse proxies and divide incoming requests among available servers.
- ADCs use a virtual IP address (VIP) to seamlessly connect incoming client requests to the appropriate server.
- ADCs help solve some of the limitations of DNS-based load balancing, such as control over client behavior, determining the closest server, and faster recovery from failures.

Note: While DNS-based load balancing is a form of GSLB, other methods like ADCs and cloud-based load balancing are more advanced options for GSLB.


Advanced Details of Load Balancers
  Load balancers distribute client requests to servers based on different algorithms. Some common algorithms include round-robin scheduling, weighted round-robin, least connections, least response time, IP hash, and URL hash. Load balancers can be static or dynamic, with dynamic algorithms considering the current state of servers for better forwarding decisions.

  Load balancers can be stateful or stateless. Stateful load balancing maintains session information between clients and servers, while stateless load balancing is faster and lighter but may require additional state for routing requests correctly.

  There are two types of load balancers based on OSI layers: Layer 4 load balancers that operate on transport protocols like TCP and UDP, and Layer 7 load balancers that use application layer protocols for application-aware forwarding decisions.

  Load balancing is typically implemented using multiple layers of load balancers, including tier-0 (DNS), tier-1 (ECMP routers), tier-2 (layer 4 load balancers), and tier-3 (layer 7 load balancers).

  Load balancers can be implemented as hardware devices, software solutions on commodity hardware, or cloud-based services (LBaaS).

  Overall, load balancers are essential for distributing traffic, maintaining session information, improving performance, and ensuring high availability in enterprise-level services.
