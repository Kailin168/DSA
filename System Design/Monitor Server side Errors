Design of a Monitoring System

Explore the initial design of a generic monitoring system. Here are the key points covered:
    1. Requirements:
      - The monitoring system should be able to monitor various aspects of the server, including local processes, resource usage (CPU/memory/disk/network), server health, hardware component faults, critical services, network infrastructure, power consumption, routing information, DNS, latency, and overall service health.
      - Automated monitoring is desired, with anomaly detection and alerts.

    2. Building blocks:
      - The system will utilize blob storage to store metric information.

    3. High-level design:
      - The monitoring system consists of three main components:
        - Storage: A time-series database stores metric data, such as CPU usage or application exceptions.
        - Data collector service: This component fetches relevant data from each service and stores it in the storage.
        - Querying service: An API that allows querying the time-series database to retrieve relevant information.

    The high-level design provides an overview of how the monitoring system will function and the key components involved. By storing metric data and utilizing a data collector and querying service, the system can effectively monitor and retrieve information about the server's performance and health.

Detailed Design of a Monitoring System

    Detailed design of a monitoring system, including its components, pros, cons, and potential improvements. Here are the key points covered:

    1. Storage:
      - Time-series databases are used to save data locally on the monitoring server.
      - Blob storage is utilized to store metrics, while a separate storage node is added to store rules and actions.

    2. Data collector:
      - A pull-based strategy is chosen, where relevant metrics are extracted from application logs using a distributed messaging queue.
      - The data collector retrieves metrics from services and stores them in the time-series database.

    3. Service discoverer:
      - A service discovery solution is employed to locate the services that need to be monitored, integrating with platforms like EC2, Kubernetes, and Consul.

    4. Querying service:
      - A service is implemented to access the database and retrieve query results for specific metrics or alerts.

    5. Alert Manager:
      - Responsible for sending alerts when rules are violated, using various communication channels such as email or Slack.

    6. Dashboard:
      - Metrics collected are used to create dashboards displaying relevant information, such as request counts.

    Pros:
    - The monitoring system ensures smooth operations and proactively identifies potential issues.
    - The pull-based approach reduces network congestion by fetching data from services.
    - The system provides higher availability.

    Cons:
    - Scaling can become challenging, particularly when managing an increasing number of servers to monitor.
    - Storing a large amount of data indefinitely can be resource-intensive, requiring policies and mechanisms for periodic data deletion.

    Improving the design:
    - To address scalability concerns, a hybrid approach combining push-based and pull-based strategies is proposed.
    - Secondary monitoring servers push data to a primary data center server, which then pushes data to a global monitoring service overseeing multiple data centers.
    - Blob storage and elastic search are used to store and visualize excessive data.
    - A hierarchy of monitoring systems allows for scaling by adding more nodes or levels as needed.

    The detailed design provides insights into the various components of the monitoring system, highlights its strengths and weaknesses, and suggests improvements to enhance scalability and data management.
