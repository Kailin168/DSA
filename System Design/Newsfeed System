System design for Newsfeed System

What is a Newsfeed?
A newsfeed on social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, is a dynamic list of stories generated by entities that a user follows. It includes various types of content like text, images, videos, likes, comments, shares, and advertisements. The newsfeed is continuously updated and presented to users on their home page, featuring posts from friends, followers, groups, and pages.
