PUB-SUB

What is a pub-sub system?
A pub-sub system, short for publish-subscribe messaging, is a method of asynchronous communication between services in serverless and microservices architectures. It allows messages to be sent asynchronously to various subsystems of a system. In the pub-sub model, messages are published by a sender (publisher) and received by multiple recipients (subscribers) that have subscribed to the topic or channel associated with the message.
