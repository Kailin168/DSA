Typehead System Design 

Typeahead suggestion, or autocomplete, is a feature that suggests queries as users type in a search box. It offers a list of suggestions based on the user's search history, the current context, and popular content. Although it doesn't speed up the search, it helps users form sentences quickly, enhancing the overall search experience.

Design Process Overview

Requirements

Requirements are vital for system design. Key considerations include:
Functioning Backwards:
  - Identify customers and their characteristics.
  - Consider user use cases.
  - Address business problems from a business standpoint.
Functional Requirements:
  - Provide a list of suggestions as users type.
  - Address questions related to the number and order of suggestions, local storage, and personalization.
Non-Functional Requirements:
  - Define scaling, latency, and availability requirements.
  - Discuss topics such as traffic estimates, storage estimates, and bandwidth requirements.

Scalability Estimation
- Consider the number of searches per day (5 billion).
- Estimate unique queries (20% of 5 billion).
- Calculate storage requirements for daily unique queries.
- Estimate bandwidth for handling 60K searches per second.

Algorithm Discussion: Trie Data Structure

- Introduce trie as a tree structure for efficient string searches.
- Explain trie's usage in constructing suggestions based on user prefixes.
- Discuss trie's benefits, such as ease of construction and traversal.
