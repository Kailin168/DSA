Understanding Failures in Distributed Systems

Introduction
Sometimes, even well-established services face failures, making us wonder how meticulously designed systems can still encounter issues. Exploring major failures in known services and strategies to minimize such incidents.

1. Diverse Users:
   - Evolving user needs drive continuous updates to software.
   - Stability can lead to a lack of desired features.
2. Complex Systems:
   - System complexity results in emergent properties.
   - The collective complexity surpasses individual components.

Types of Failures in Distributed Systems:
1. System Failure:
   - Commonly caused by software or hardware issues.
   - Primary memory contents are lost, but secondary storage or replicas remain intact.
