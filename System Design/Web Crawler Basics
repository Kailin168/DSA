Web Crawler Basics

A web crawler is like a smart robot that explores the internet to gather information. It starts by visiting specific web addresses and collects data from those pages. This collected data is then stored for later use.

1. Why do we use web crawlers?

1. Testing Web Pages: Web crawlers help check if web page links and structures are correct.
2. Monitoring Changes: They keep an eye on updates in web page content or structure.
3. Site Mirroring: Web crawlers can effectively copy popular websites.
4. Copyright Check: They fetch content and look for copyright issues.

2. Requirements and Goals
Our web crawler needs to be:
- Scalable: Capable of handling millions of web documents.
- Extensible: Designed to add new features and handle different types of content.

3. Some Design Considerations
Before diving in, we need to consider:
- Content Types: Will our crawler fetch only HTML pages or also images, videos, etc.?
- Protocols: Initially, we'll focus on HTTP, with room to add FTP and others later.
- Scale: Expecting to crawl billions of pages, so storage and processing must be efficient.
- Robots.txt: Handling rules from websites on what can be crawled (Robots Exclusion Protocol).


The web crawler is designed to systematically explore the internet, collect data, and store it for various applications. The proposed design involves thoughtful consideration of requirements, estimation, interface, data storage, system flow, and physical implementation, with ongoing improvements and evaluations to enhance its efficiency.
